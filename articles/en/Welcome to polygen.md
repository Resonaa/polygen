#### How to Mention Users

- Putting the username right after `@`:

  @Test `@Test`

- Mentioning multiple users in a single line:

  @161 @162 `@161 @162`

- Adding `@` equally on both sides:

  @@User 1606@ Test `@@User 1606@ Test`

- Escaping through successive `@`:

  @@Test `@@Test`

- Integrating with other syntax rules:

  ~@Test~ _@Test_ `~@Test~ _@Test_`
